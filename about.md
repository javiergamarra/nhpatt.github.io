Javier Gamarra, nhpatt on the internet.

Developer always eager to learn and improve.

I'm working as an Android developer at [Liferay](http://liferay.com) and I've worked in many development stacks: JS (angular, node...), Java EE, Scala or python.

I love challenges and learning about data visualization.

I am an organizer in [@cylicon_valley](http://twitter.com/cylicon_valley), a tech meetup in CyL, to help spread better technical practices in other companies and a member of the board of [@agilespain](http://twitter.com/agilespain), the Spanish Agile national association. I also organize and give talks in several other tech groups.

I'm available through <a href="mailto:nhpatt@gmail.com">email</a> or [twitter](http://twitter.com/nhpatt), [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/javiergamarraolmedo), [github](http://github.com/nhpatt), [facebook](http://facebook.com/javiergamarra)...
