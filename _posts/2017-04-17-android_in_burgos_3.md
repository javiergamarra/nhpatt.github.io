Third edition of my Android workshop in Burgos, 3 days, 19 hours... slides available [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9B4rs_8HCRGS0JzaTFfOWpjLWs).

Worst edition so far :'(

We considered cancelling it due to low attendance and in the end I gave the workshop split on 3 days (9!, 5 and 5 hours). 
9 hours is definitely too much for an introductory course about Android but we didn't have more options with Holy Easter coming soon 
and other compromises.

Only 11 people attended and it should have been easier but I felt I didn't explain myself as well as other editions and 
the attendees couldn't keep up the rhythm of the course. 

I've received very little feedback about the lessons (just 1 answer in the form) and no projects to review as other editions. 
That's definitely a very bad signal. I'll try to insist in one email... but I'm less than hopeful.

Things I would do different next time (if there is one):

* I would start with a basic Java introductory lesson for people who don't know Java or know very little programming at all. 
At least to set a basic minimum for the workshop. An IDE lesson would be great too.
* Do a daily with, what have you learned today? instead of the brief summary I do at the beginning of the next session.
* Ask each one what does expects of the course. If someone wants to do a real app, insist on sharing the repository.
* Force them to upload the exercises to github and review them between lessons.
* Think in ways of doing the course more practical but without the feeling I had in this edition, that I was just stalling 
the course because no one was doing the exercises. It's possible the good solution is less content.

I think that the metric of success in a workshop is how many people are pursuing real projects with that technology. 
I do know that some people attend courses just to know the possibilities of the technology and have a 10.000 feet view on how to do things.

But it's impossible that no one has a direct interest on practicing the technology. With that metric in mind, I'm afraid this edition has been a 
profound failure.

Any ideas?
