**I'm not a good developer advocate**. That is a sad fact. Alas (or should I say luckily?), I'm not one.

One small example of my ineptitude communicating things, happened on Thursday when a friend asked me **if we were 
uploading the videos of the meetups** hosted on Liferay somewhere...

I've spent countless hours (because I haven't actively counted them, but [rescuetime](https://www.rescuetime.com/) says that at least 100 **just** editing in [blackmagic davinci](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve)) 
painstakingly processing videos, syncing the slides, notifying meetups and dealing with bureaucracy for close to 120 recordings (in 3 channels, with synced slides and without them).

And **I haven't tweeted about it or linked the channel anywhere**. The only ones who knew the channel existed where the ones that 
attended the meetups.

Yesterday [Modesto](https://twitter.com/msanjuan) told me that I should create a playlist for each meetup and when I entered the 
channel (one of the 3 that host liferay talks) I noticed that had 250 subscribers. Those 250 persons had joined a youtube
channel by a user without logo (a grey default background), URL, description or cover image. Basically nothing.

So I've cleaned a bit that channel and created playlists for every meetup we host.

**The channel is called Liferay Agora and it's available [here](https://www.youtube.com/liferayagora).**

And here is a playlist with almost all the recordings (except the internal ones and some that the meetups wanted to be private):

frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

I also recommend the **liferay official youtube channel that is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/liferayinc/)** and has some of the videos (with the 
slides synced).

Any doubts, complaints (why you downvote a video without commenting the reason?) or feedback is more than welcomed on [twitter](https://twitter.com/nhpatt).

I'll talk about hosting meetups, ordering pizzas and moving chairs some other time...

PD: another example of bad communicating is posting blog post entries and not publicising them :P
