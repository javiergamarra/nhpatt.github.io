I've read [Tribal Leadership](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2741559-tribal-leadership) and it's not you, it's me.
I have some gripes with this kind of books...

Tribal Leadership (2008) is a famous business book by Dave Logan, John King & Halee Fischer-Wright and it was the next book in the 
[Madriagil](https://www.meetup.com/madriagil/) book club. I don't usually read business books but I'm a firm follower 
of the book club.

The book, basically, affirms that **tribes are the key to the success of companies** (Ok) and that can be classified into 5 stages:

1. Life sucks! 
2. My life sucks!
3. I’m great!
4. My life’s great!
5. Life’s great!

I have exactly the same problem I had with [The Five Dysfunctions of a team](http://localhost:4000/dysfunctions/)... **it 
sounds scientific but it isn't**. I can't trust a book that says that 2% or 18% of the companies are in a specific stage... 
how do you get those numbers? how can you classify a big company so neatly... at least some teams will belong to stage 2 and others to stage 4... 
[Dunbar's number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number) is also used to set the maximum number of participants of a tribe. 
I have gripes with that neat (150) number. And Malcolm Gladwell also uses it!

The last chapters discuss triads as the magic recipe for success and accountability and I'm sorry, I can't grasp their magic. 

Instead of telling a story it uses examples and experiences from real companies (at least one has closed down). Examples and anecdotes are always fun but
it's difficult to extract a theory for success from them... survivor bias.

Again, after 5 dysfunctions, **we can classify success or failure with 5 buckets**. I'm a skeptic of a world so simple that 
 problems can be differentiated with a nice 5 bullet point slide. I have to say that lots of parts of stage 3 tribes resonated with my life experiences, 
 but again also some parts of all stages...

I think the world (and teams and companies) **are complex systems** and it's usually impossible to simplify problems to
"your tribe is currently in stage 2 and you have to move it to stage 3".

But **if it helps you, who I am to judge, go for it**! The AMAZING Corinna Baldauf (of [Retromat](https://retromat.org/en/?id=106-126-26-13-23) fame, keynote in CAS15) made a 1-page cheat sheet to help you guide tribes:
