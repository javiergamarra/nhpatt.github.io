I've been reading quite a lot this year (as I did on 2016). I usually start strong and then slip out in summer and catch
up on the last months of the year.

I have to force myself to read because I would rather browse endlessly without any purpose. But when I start I can't stop,
it's quite common for me to have to set up deadlines at night at 1 or 2 AM if the book is really interesting.

There are some things they work for me, like:

* **Following a book club**. The [Agile Madrid book club](https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/madriagil/events/233709899/) reads a book every 1 or 2 months about agile, software or management and
that public compromise means that, since it started, I've read 7 or 8 books I would have read otherwise (or it would have taken me 
several years to do it). Public compromises work well with my brain.
* **Setting an objective in [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/)** works wonders with me. That's the main reason why I read so many books in 2016 or I have started strong this year. 
Just seeing the objective several times a week energizes me a lot and teases me to start a new book. 
It didn't work last year because I didn't start with a good rhythm but it did in 2016 and this year.
* **Following friends** in Goodreads and seeing what they have read, finished or want to read it also helps me a lot. It serves 2 purposes, the first
one being a source of recommendations and books to check out. The second one is teasing me with their progress and motivating me to read more.
* One thing I've started to do this year is having a book on the PC and the mobile phone, to read when I'm tired or I have some spare minutes.
For example, I usually read 5 minutes while I queue for some food, instead of checking twitter or facebook.
* I also have some alternatives if I get tired reading a technical book or a serious book, like some comics or some manga series... I'm usually reading 3 or 4 books at the same time, one technical and one or two fiction books. 
* Starting works really well :P. I'm usually with the computer on weekends reading twitter or doing nothing at all... I'm reading a book or a manga now instead.

And I also have bad habits like always finishing the book even if I despise it or having to end a book series that I've started.
Don't do this.

Happy reading!
