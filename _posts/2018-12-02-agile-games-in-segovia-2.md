Another crazy week, this time we hosted 7 meetups (1 canceled, we were targeting 8), had another hectic work week and I gave a workshop at the University of Segovia (strictly UVa, Segovia's campus).

The topic was Agile Games and it was pretty similar to the one I gave 2 years ago. Slides are [here](http://bit.ly/agile-segovia
). 

The agenda was simple:

* Agile game: a chocolate dilemma
* Theory
* Agile game: [We're having a party](http://tastycupcakes.org/2009/06/were-having-a-party/)
* Agile game: Lego serious play
* Final words and retro ([Learning Matrix](https://retromat.org/en/?id=9))

## Feedback

The workshop went fine. I had the feeling that **I was losing their attention** in the half an hour of theory but they loved the games. **I have to rethink how to make that theory part more palatable**.

It was nice to see that they manage to pact a common strategy in the *chocolate dilemma* game and they immediately saw the benefits of single item flow in the *We're having a party* game.

I tried new things with the Lego game and they worked fine, like handing them some stories in an A4 and others as cards. A group used the scissors to split the A4 into cards and sort/prioritize them.

I think that it wasn't the best run of the game and other times they teams learned more or had more fun but it went great nevertheless.

These are the individual items of feedback I recollected:

### :)

* "Juego de Lego :)", "Lego mola!!!", "Jugar con Lego para entender Agile"
* "El primer juego (de las monedas) ha sido muy interesante"
* "Juego de las invitaciones"
* "Aprender jugando"

### :(

* "Mucha teoría", "Teoría"
* "No me gusta venir a la uni los viernes" (that one is not my fault!)
* **"Resulta más difícil volver a centrarse en la teoría después de un juego (si la teoría no está relacionada con el juego)"**. Great point, I have to resort the slides and spread/split the theory.

### Ideas

* "Más juegos y ejemplos para entender historias de usuario"
* "Chuches variadas y para todos"
* "Más divulgación y cursos acerca del Agile"
* **"Teoría pero con algo más de práctica"**


### Appreciation

* -

## Final words

I found it really hard to focus on preparing the games after this last *awful* month... once in flow I **love** giving talks at universities (even I'm not very good at it) so, hopefully, I'll be there next year :)
