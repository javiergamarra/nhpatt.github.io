Let's continue reading [REST: from research to practice](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11865715-rest). I'm doing so you do not have to do it.

## Quantifying Integration Architectures

Another arid paper that tries to cover how to minimize coupling with the goal of adapting to changing requirements and reduce time to market.

The chapter/paper covers several times of changes and the impact they cause:

Once classified, it tries to quantify the impact of a change in several connectors (shared files, databases, RPC APIs, REST...). Unsurprisingly, REST wins. And that's, more or less, all the chapter.

## FOREST: An Interacting Object Web

## Last words (for now)

**I'll be back**.

I've given several talks on REST and Hypermedia... [these](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xXB2HH0P-h2fpPxKN28gYSH8cyitH85akiJNCBErQKk/edit?usp=sharing) are the slides I'm most proud of (because the theme is based on Cindy Lauper, and Cindy Lauper is God).

I'm on twitter at [nhpatt](https://twitter.com/nhpatt) if you want to read more, sporadic, ramblings :)
