Three weeks without posts. I've been pretty busy: I've attended 4 conferences, 4 meetups, gave a talk and a workshop, appeared in an interview, and become the new lead of the headless experience team.

The 17th and 18th of October I went to the [Liferay Spanish Symposium](https://www.liferay.com/web/events-symposium-spain). First experience without having a talk nor being a volunteer... quite strange.

Later I attended [JSDayES](http://2018.jsday.es/). I recommend 3 talks, [Gonzalo Ruiz de Vila with How to build an AI in 40 minutes](http://2018.jsday.es/#5703712089571328/168654001), [Rubén Valseca with How a Virtual DOM works](http://2018.jsday.es/#5703712089571328/162714003) and
[Ibon Tolosana with Vanilla JS Graphics and Animations](http://2018.jsday.es/#5703712089571328/160764004).

The previous week I attended the [LambaWorld](http://www.lambda.world/) in Cádiz at the same time [my interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CwOI9z-U3-8) with Alba and Autentia was released :)

Last Saturday I gave a workshop with [Victor](https://twitter.com/Votilde) about voice recognition with Javascript + many raspberries. It went Ok. [Here](http://bit.ly/voicejs) are the slides. We spent too much time in the first exercises and we only covered like 30% of the content :P

And this wednesday I gave a talk with [Nacho](https://twitter.com/juanignaciosl) and [Isidro](https://twitter.com/isidromerayo). I should have prepared the slides because I'm way worse than Nacho improvising and I wish have transmitted the message clearer. [Here](http://bit.ly/cyliconuva) are the slides.

In the middle of this, I also became the new lead of the Headless Experience team at Liferay. Not my merit at all.

I also missed another conference and another meetup :(

Now I just wish to have some calm and quiet weeks ahead :)
