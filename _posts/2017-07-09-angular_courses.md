**[UPDATE]**

I've added several reader suggestions :)

Sorry for the picture, I *do* know it's horrible and I contribute to its ugliness.

I really **like angular**. I know it's over-architected, very complex and can be replaced with React and a few libraries. 
But I also think that **frameworks are not bad *per se***, we lose flexibility but they guide us in how to develop a feature.

That's why I think angular makes sense depending on the type of project, the team developing it and the company.

I've been tinkering with angular since the [beta3](https://code.angularjs.org/2.0.0-beta.3/)? and I've given several talks and courses.
Exactly 5 (!) courses about angular, being even more specific these ones:

* In February 2016 I gave a course (12 hours) to [Brooktec](http://brooktec.com/) about, what was called back then, angular2.
* In February 2017 gave an angular workshop, 4 afternoons (4*4 hours), in the URJC with [MadridJS](https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/madridjs/events/236300297/).
* In May 2017, I gave two, 8 hours sessions, to [KairosDS](http://www.kairosds.com/).
* Also in May, I recorded the [OpenWebinars](https://openwebinars.net/cursos/angular/?ref=landing-cursos) courses responsible for that picture. 10 hours of video, slides, theory, repository... 
* And last but not least, I've given an angular course to [Luce](http://www.luceit.com/) in 5 afternoons (5*3 hours).

## Feedback

And the feedback has been... **good and lacking**. In brooktec no-one responded the feedback form, 3 persons in luce (5% with all the sessions), 8 in kairos (32%), 15 in the URJC (5%) and currently 9 in openwebinars (5%). 

**I would love to have more answers** :(

The general feedback is quite good (4.4/5 is the lowest mean of the courses and 4.67/5 the highest) but there are some 3's that hurt, especially in OpenWebinars where I don't know the reasons :(

These are the **main things I have to improve**:

* More *advanced* content
* More time for exercises

If you think those 2 objectives are the opposite of each other, I also agree. I'm continuously juggling between the decision of showing more content or reviewing the exercises. I don't have an answer.

I have tried to close that gap offering **hangouts** or personal sessions **to solve doubts or show advanced content** whenever the attendees can. But it has been a **profound failure**. 

I've proposed many dates for a hangout (no-one came), send doodles... I once sent a doodle to 2x developers, no-one answered, I told them so and gave another opportunity and, again, no-one answered :'(  

I have a small theory: it's different (mentally) to plan to attend to a workshop that to a hangout (where you can be the only one there). 
I don't think the dates/times are the problem because I've offered a lot of, different, options. It has to be something in the brain, that reserves time to attend a course but doesn't want to pursue the topic further.

As I told you, I'm out of possible solutions... **any ideas?**

## More problems

The feedback forms also commented several problems with the courses, these ones:

* **More interactive content**
* Show a real application
* Spend more time explaining why *x* feature is useful
* Less content about observables (specific to angular)

Both four are true but the first 2 ones are more important (IMHO). I have to prepare more interactive courses. I have several ideas but I don't execute them. I've tried leaving exercises, optional exercises and encouraging personal projects. **Do you have any suggestions?** (I'm nhpatt in twitter and gmail!)

I can fix all of those without angering any other attendee so I'll try to do it for next courses!

I want to update the [Toledo App](https://github.com/nhpatt/angular2-toledo) and public a big open source project... so that will cover the *show a real application* feedback.

I also plan to fill a feedback form live in the next course, to show that I can accept real criticism and that it takes just 2 minutes.

As always, I'm still **open to having a hangout** with whoever wants to learn more about angular...

## Final words

I've written some [previous](http://localhost:4000/aprender-ensenando/) [posts](/android_in_burgos_3/) about feedback... and I've tried several of the objectives I mentioned. But I haven't forced the people to do a personal project nor answer the feedback form. 

I'm trying to manage expectations (and I think I have improved in that regard) but I'm lacking the confidence to do questions or force the attendees to do something. 

This is now my go-to post for preparing a course, along with this [one](/android_in_burgos_3/). This is the TL;DR conclusions:

* Force them to create a real project
* Manage expectations
* Do dailies instead of summaries
* Look for more interactive content
* Review exercises 
* **Short feedback cycles**
* Fill a feedback form with them
* Prepare basic content in an introductory session/hangout (along with setting up a minimum and enforcing it)
* Taunt the audience with questions
* Set an objective for the session
* Commit per exercise, references at the beginning...
* Insist on *please, ask questions!*

Reader suggestions:

* Differentiate levels and target the needs of each level
* Propose a real, already solved, problem (like twitter, hacker news...) but leave open a part to personalize and make their own.
* Use storytelling to narrate the problem to solve, to explain that is a **real problem**
 
**I'll keep you updated** with my particular transparency.
