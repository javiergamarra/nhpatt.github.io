After a small fail with the [wednesday post](/hackatrain) just a very brief post.

Feedback of the lechazoconf. How it went according to the attendees?

Well, it was like [this](https://nhpatt.typeform.com/report/vOHEVq/FyWq):

* **8,63**/10 talks (min 7)
* **8.95**/10 food (min 6)
* **8.79**/10 venue (min 7)

And, asked if they would return next year, the results are:

* 4.84/5 would come (min 4)

Things to improve, apart from the ones I mentioned in my [previous post](/lechazoconf_feedback)...
 
* More technical talks: 42% 
* **Nothing!**: 37% 
* 2 days of conference instead of 1: 16% 
* Other: 16%  
* Less talks: 5%

And I end with this, emotional feedback. I want to hug the person that wrote it:

*"Como Vallisoletano ese día me sentí orgullosisimo de esta ciudad, su gente y la calidad/inquietud de profesionales de nuestro sector. 
Solo quería daros las gracias porque no son muchas las ocasiones en las que siento este orgullo"*

**Thank you so much!**
