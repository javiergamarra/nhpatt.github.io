One thing I've learned (or done a lot) last year is processing tech videos that I recorded, either with my computer (QuickTime) in courses/workshops
or with Liferay's cameras.

Most of them are here, in this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMFPijRwTpo&list=PLKb_gn-WO_KqzIbHIROyIr3siK_f3NgL6) but I've processed more for CyLicon Valley or Liferay and hosted in other meetup channels. For example, these ones of a CyLicon Valley meetup:

* ¿Cómo es mi software por dentro? - Kiuwan por Luis Rodríguez

* Git para usuarios .NET - GMaster por Pablo Santos

I am now quite fast doing it, I can sync the slides with the recording while watching a TV show (an awful one is perfect for the task) and with a medium sized talk (40-50 slides) it takes me *about 1 hour* to do everything (including adding the header, meetup logo, texts, positioning everything...).

I don't know if it is useful, though... because:

* People **keep demanding them but they don't have many visualizations** (usually less than 50).
* I don't know if the **layout is useful** or if it's better to record the screen, set the video to 90%...
* I'm not **promoting them** in any way, apart from posting the URL in the meetup when it's uploaded.
* I have **many problems with** talks with a lot of **live coding**, I have to switch between camera positions or focus on the video and I don't usually
do it fast enough. 

**Should I keep doing it?** Do you prefer another layout? Do you get any value from it? Should I create a website listing all the tech talks and videos with recommendations? 

I'm at [@nhpatt](https://twitter.com/nhpatt) if you want to discuss it!
