The 2nd and 3rd of June (time passes so quickly!) I attended the [pamplonaswcraft](http://pamplonaswcraft.com/), a crafts(wo)manship conference. 

It was my first time (I couldn't go last year and the Barcelona conf also coincided with a Liferay conf) but I knew a lot of people, I even met old friends that I didn't recognize at the beginning :)

The conference was a mixture of Open Space and talks and I thought it would work worse than it did but it was groovy, great idea!

Of the 12 talks/slots, these are the six I liked more:

* [Being agile, Tuenti style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkotqWXIU50&index=3&list=PLKxa4AIfm4pWzA2ILUMUDwD_0QGIIJetn) by [Fina Pérez](https://twitter.com/finuka). 
    
    A really good talk about what it really means to be agile and full of real experiences.

* [Same old story, brand new problems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5Q10Z_WlFc&index=12&list=PLKxa4AIfm4pWzA2ILUMUDwD_0QGIIJetn) by [Angélica Lozano](https://twitter.com/alozalv).

    Angelica is a **really great speaker** and [mLean](https://m-lean.com/) is facing (and surpassing!) great challenges in the industry sector, where everything is different...
    
* **¿Qué estamos haciendo mal?** 

    An open discussion about diversity in software development and how can we try to solve this problem and create more welcoming conferences, spaces, and companies. I left the session having 
    learned a few things that I didn't notice before. [Jorge](https://twitter.com/flipper83) owes us a trello with ideas (:P)
    
* [Building a transactional function pipeline (with TDD and Elixir)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ7NUNA1ONU&index=2&list=PLKxa4AIfm4pWzA2ILUMUDwD_0QGIIJetn) by [Javier Acero](https://twitter.com/jacegu)

    The talk was not what I was expecting but I learned Elixir from the ground up and with really clear explanations in each step. Jacegu is *simply* great (see what I did there).

* **Speed dating**

    A speed dating activity, getting us to know each other in 5? minutes. Really nice, I met awesome, passionate, people. 

* **Powerpoint karaoke**

    Another open space proposal, I didn't know this format. Basically, a volunteer accepted to present some slides (with automatic transitions after some seconds) that he didn't see before. 
    
    **Hilarious**. I was crying of laughter. Also "The marketing is your own architecture". Had lots of fun and with the best timing, being the last slot of the conference when we were really tired after very long days. Definitely going back if someone proposes another session.
    
And that's all!

I was expecting more technical talks but in the end, I chose the less technical ones in each slot. Am I getting older? :P
