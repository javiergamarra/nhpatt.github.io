Let's continue reading [REST: from research to practice](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11865715-rest). I'm doing it so you do not have to (these 6 chapters were HARD).

## From Requirements to a RESTful Web Service: Engineering Content Oriented Web Services with REST

Requirements to RESTful Web Service.

    Web services look more like a collection of unrelated APIs instead of a set of interlinked content accessible using a uniform interface.
    
Agree 100%.

Requirements to implementation passing through UML. I'm too old for this.


## A Framework for Rapid Development of REST Web Services for Integrating Information Systems

approach requires a common vocabulary, which contains definitions of all resource types that are used by the participants. Such a vocabulary can be realized in many different forms. One of the most effective ways of formal knowledge representation and sharing it in a coherent and consistent manner among interacting software agents is ontology

use drivers


## Managing Legacy Telco Data Using RESTful Web Services

## Case Study on the Use of REST Architectural Principles for Scientific Analysis:
   CAMERA â€“ Community Cyberinfrastructure for Advanced Microbial Ecology Research and Analysis

## Practical REST in Data-centric Business Applications: The Case of Cofidis Hispania

## RESTifying Real-World Systems: A Practical Case Study in RFID

## Last words (for now)

**I'll be back**.

I've given several talks on REST and Hypermedia... [these](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1xXB2HH0P-h2fpPxKN28gYSH8cyitH85akiJNCBErQKk/edit?usp=sharing) are the slides I'm most proud of (because the theme is based on Cindy Lauper, and Cindy Lauper is God).

I'm on twitter at [nhpatt](https://twitter.com/nhpatt) if you want to read more, sporadic, ramblings :)
