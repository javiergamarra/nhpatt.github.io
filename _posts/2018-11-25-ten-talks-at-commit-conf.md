Just yesterday I gave two talks at the [CommitConf](https://2018.commit-conf.com/), raising the number of talks there to 10 (!). And I'm still an Ok-not-great speaker :(

Here are all the talks:

* [Opinionated Android](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9B4rs_8HCRGNmg1Tl9zWmduRFE)
* [5 meses de juegos ágiles](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9B4rs_8HCRGZHpSMXQ2U0RRT3c)
* [Cambiar una empresa con juegos ágiles](https://drive.google.com/open?id=12a35kBxwpnjU7z8QyZFKAiJs52aHoK0MKrayq1c9zT4) with a 4.59 and 17 reviews
* [RxJava en práctica, de 0 a master](https://drive.google.com/open?id=17I4K59P7d-RIWVUwfq3R0xyFi4Nhr4P7xkME4wqjSTQ) with a 4.31 and 16 reviews
* [Ionic2 and angular2 in practice](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LHb9WQqBMUii9yg3gHMTaJ11669F4qsFillaIUlDqcc) with a fair 4 and 17 reviews
* [Métricas: lo bueno, lo feo y lo malo](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9B4rs_8HCRGeTJHNUItcHEzMDA) with a fair-unfair 3.42 and 50 reviews :'(
* [Nativescript en práctica](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1tuOnP6_glVULkPdLO38cxLqZwCeQOoq9qcvbySUHoFA) with a perfect 5.0 and 2 reviews.
* [Jugando con Android Things](https://drive.google.com/open?id=11iivhkRzTFhV3JlaZUbk-Bau3GeDtjaBtFfE6uhQnwo) with a perfect 5.0 and 4 reviews.
* [Construye tu propio assistant con raspberry pi y javascript](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RAGtQuxjFxJGwxmnKePk2cmRx8M_E-GW0kniH9PP0IU) with a 4.0 and 5 reviews. Including a completely unfair 1 (complaining about the lack of material and lying about the number of attendees)
* [WebGL y three.js: creando Manhattan](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Jo80D688D94DLE4cSSn1tMXBffOcZNSjpaYXgCF9EZQ) with a 4.9 and 7 reviews.

2016 was not a good year... (3.42 with Esther and 4.0 alone). I arrived directly to the Codemotion from my honeymoon's trip and I didn't coordinate
the presentation with Esther (sorry :()...

I can't brag with a 4.0 average score (4,37 without the metrics talk) but, surprisingly, is in line with most of the speakers (including famous ones) except
superhumans like [Katia](https://www.koliseo.com/katiaaresti) with a 4.75 and [flipper](https://www.koliseo.com/flipper83) with a 4.56.

I want to think that I've gotten better and, since last year, I only send talks involving other people, to help them give a first/second talk at a big conference. 

Maybe it's time to rest.
