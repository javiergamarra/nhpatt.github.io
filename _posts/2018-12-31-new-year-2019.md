Last day of the year... a year ago I [posted](https://nhpatt.com/new_year/) my commitments for 2018 (lower my WIP, read again & exercise) and I only accomplished one and a half... I did lower my WIP but it's still too high, with a lot of rework and no exercise in sight :(

2018 was a strange year, in the professional and personal sense... not as good as 2017 but good nevertheless... I went to fewer conferences, visited fewer countries and I blew many, many, many more deadlines. Too many balls rolling at the same time, many distractions and way less focus than previous years. That is my main commitment for 2019, **to regain focus and do fewer things**.

So for 2019, these are my new year resolutions:

* **Lower my WIP** to 3 or fewer *projects* a week. 
    I try to do too many things at the same time, with horrendous results. I can't try to organize a conference, manage the budget of another, prepare a talk... at the same time. 
    
    I have to do fewer things at the same time and **close** unfinished projects.
* Do more **exercise** as much as 2016 (2000km biking and 10.000 steps per day should be achievable)
* Sleep more. Enough said.
* Try to **read again** as much as in 2018, 52 books/comics a year
* As an extra goal, finishing one of my long-term paused projects would be ideal...

And that's all. I don't want to repeat 2018, I want a razor-sharp focus in 2019, we'll see :D
