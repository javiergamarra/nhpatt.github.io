This week I was invited to the [GDG Summit](https://blog.gdg.es/search/label/GDG%20Spain%20summit) as part of the organizers of [LechazoConf](https://lechazoconf.com)... and 
it was quite nice. **Thank you so much [Almo](https://twitter.com/davilagrau) and [Carlos](https://twitter.com/carlosazaustre) for the invite!**

The GDG Summit is the yearly meeting of all the [Google Developer Groups](https://gdg.es/) of Spain and they talk about how to energize communities,
organize events in schools, deal with conflicts... **it's a really cool initiative to spread knowledge across communities**
and create bonds between cities and organizers. 

This year was held in Tenerife, at the same time as the [Tenerife Lan Party](https://tlp-tenerife.com/) (TLP for short).
The TLP is a huge LAN Party (2000+ attendees) + cosplay event + stands + tech talks ([TLP Innova](https://tlp-tenerife.com/tlpinnova/)) + lots of things! The Summit
had one day of open talks about technology, open for the public and one day of internal talks about communities.

I was amazed by **the work behind the TLP and the GDG Summit by [Paco](https://twitter.com/pacomartinfdez) and [Alicia](https://twitter.com/aliciamartinfe1)**.
I definitely know how hard is to organize a medium-sized event like the CAS and I can't fathom how is to mount something for 2000+
attendees. Really nice work üëèüëèüëè. 

I had a blast at the event and learned a lot about how the GDG are organized. But I especially liked several things that I have to mention, without any particular order:

* **The passion that [@icynthia](https://twitter.com/icynthia) transmits** in her talks and continuously. We hosted her in the Facebook
Dev Circle Madrid and **she gave a great talk**. I thought (and the TarugoConf organizers and everyone at the GDG summit now) 
that she is one of the rising stars that every event would be lucky to have.
* I **loved [Nerea](https://twitter.com/sailormerqury) and [Mois√©s](https://twitter.com/moisipm) talk about Reinforcement Learning**. It was clear, direct, technical
and interesting.
* I **üíñ [Jorge Barroso](https://twitter.com/flipper83) and [Laura Morillo](https://twitter.com/laura_morillo) passion**. Both are the pillars of several communities and events and they enrich every
event they go.
* I was amazed (and envious!) by **the work of [Ana](https://twitter.com/AnaCidre_) and [Orestes](https://twitter.com/OrestesCA)
with the [Vigo Tech Alliance](https://vigotech.org/)**. Valladolid is like 1.5x times bigger and we can't foster a community with more
than one meetup, let alone 200 events in one year.
* I was surprised by the initiative of someone so young as [Abdallah](https://twitter.com/aabedraba). When I was a university student, I'm pretty sure I
wasn't organizing events nor community booths.

I'm missing lots of things that were awesome, thanks to all for contributing to the event :) 

It was great to talk, although too briefly, with [Mois√©s](https://twitter.com/moisipm) about the [T3chFest](https://twitter.com/T3chFest) challenges (we definitely missed
[Nerea](https://twitter.com/sailormerqury) there!). I wanted to talk with [Theba](https://twitter.com/kooltheba) and [Ulises](https://twitter.com/kom_256) about the great work they 
are doing with the [OSW community](https://twitter.com/os_weekends) but I'm too shy :(

And, obviously, old friends like [Yeray](https://twitter.com/ydarias), [Miguel](https://twitter.com/mcatalanb), [Patarino](https://twitter.com/npatarino), 
[Aurora](https://twitter.com/aurora_barrero), [Reinaldo](https://twitter.com/reiaguilera), [Rub√©n](https://twitter.com/akelael), 
and the people from [GDG Burgos](https://twitter.com/gdgburgos) (sorry :( I forgot that I already knew you from the Android course and the Droidcon 2015!) 
and [GDG Salamanca](https://twitter.com/gdgsalamanca) (I'm sure I'm forgetting someone!).

I had a blast and I'll try to use the opportunity to collaborate with the GDG Burgos and Salamanca to do more things around Castile & Leon.

See you around! :)
