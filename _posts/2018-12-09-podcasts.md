# How do I listen to so many?

I love walking and I usually try to walk everywhere. I also listen to podcasts when I'm cleaning :). It makes those tasks fun, if I have an interesting podcast on the queue (like [Reply All](http://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all)), I am thrilled of having household chores!

I also listen to most of them to 2.x speed or more (:P)... in the beginning, it was quite hard but nowadays I can't stand 1.0 speed.

I use [pocketcasts](https://www.pocketcasts.com/) for Android that has a very nice UI and records everything. So here are my stats since I started using it (now almost 3 years): I've listened to 20 days & 10 hours of podcasts, saved 2 days by skipping silences and 46 days (!) by listening to them to twice the regular speed.

**Do you have any good recommendations?** I'm all ears on [twitter](https://twitter.com/nhpatt)!
