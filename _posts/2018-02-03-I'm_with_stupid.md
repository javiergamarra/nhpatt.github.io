So, on Friday I broke my PC, it seems that coffee and keyboards are not a good combination :( 

Apart from feeling awful, it served me to see what were the things that didn't have a backup...

* **Repositories**... I work on Open Source so almost everything is uploaded in github. But there are things
that weren't, like some spike branches that were just locally, the stash with some refactoring changes that weren't finished 
or some unstaged files (in this blog, 5 drafts for new posts and all the ideas for future posts :()). 

    I should have uploaded everything to github... the blog drafts, ideas and some pet project repositories was specially hurtful.

    Some things I shouldn't upload them to the official repository but I could do it to a fork.
* Entertainment... like talk recordings or books. 

    No problem at all, just re-download. Some things were painful, I've just processed a 
video talk the day before and I had to redo it again (4 hours with the computer toasted, at night).
* All the development applications, the environments... again just losing time. Quite a lot in this case.
* The important files, like business documents, work repositories were either on github, drive or dropbox. That's where everything important should be :)
* The thing that grinds my gears is that I don't know what else is missing... I'm finding it every hour when I try to use an obscure application
, a shell alias or a development environment.

Let's see if I learn something about my profound stupidness :'(
