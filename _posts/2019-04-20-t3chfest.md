So... after 1 month I'm publishing the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1C0j5YNITcnf4_6tdTYNvlVMwi1oZHwk-zOKlEDI8yCg/edit?usp=sharing) for my t3chfest talk (please comment any doubts on the slides) and the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm33ZijU-1g).

I had too many things I wanted to mention, blew the time (and I thought I had 10 minutes more) and didn't do a dry run of the talk before. Feedback was good-ish.

I didn't had time to mention the 3 slides with references so at least I wanted to point out the best ones:

* [The Truthful Art](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26401716-the-truthful-art) ([@albertocairo](https://twitter.com/albertocairo), blog, book)
* [Storytelling with Data](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26535513-storytelling-with-data) ([@storywithdata](https://twitter.com/storywithdata), blog, book)
* [informationisbeautiful](https://informationisbeautiful.net/) (blog)
* [thewhyaxis](http://thewhyaxis.info/remakes/) (blog)
* [policyviz.com](https://policyviz.com/podcast/) (podcast)
* [Talk](https://community.jmp.com/t5/Discovery-Summit-2018/Plenary-Alberto-Cairo-How-Charts-Lie-and-How-They-Make-Us/ta-p/81778) & [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLDMal5nPNA) & [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GnMSjSWDQNk) (youtube.com)
* [Miami Course](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/c0rg7lv90eg0bmm/AAB1gUGt9L9EYKWwSSla6_Pga?dl=0) (dropbox.com)


I've been **living in a haze** this last 3 months and I'm completely not up-to-date on commitments. Sorry :'(

As a final compensation of taking so long... here are some interesting tidbits I should have tweeted after the talk...

* A very good graph from the [BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-47529562):

It illustrates quite well one of the things I wanted to point out in the talk, that the graph transmits a message/tells a story.

* This compedium of mistakes from [theeconomist](https://medium.economist.com/mistakes-weve-drawn-a-few-8cdd8a42d368)

* The [FT visual vocabulary](https://github.com/ft-interactive/chart-doctor/blob/master/visual-vocabulary/Visual-vocabulary.pdf), to help you choose the best visualization.

* And **please, please, please** take a look at the winner of the Best of Show award at [Malofiej](http://www.malofiejgraphics.com/)
